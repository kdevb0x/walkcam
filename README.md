## WalkCam

* WalkCam is an android app that helps improve your awareness while you are walking,
and using your mobile smartphone at the same time.
<sup> For me usually means termux, or another attention demanding application. </sup>
* It does this by creating as small floating window, containing the view as seen
from the front facing camera, allowing you to better pay attention to where you are going.

***Truthfully how I was struck by the idea, or rather, I struck the idea, painfully. ?;\ lol.***
