# WalkCam:
***WARNING: Under Active Development; Unstable API***

- WalkCam is an android app, written in [__Go__] that helps improve your awareness while you are walking and using your mobile smartphone at the same time.

<sup> *For me usually means termux, or another attention demanding application. </sup>
- It does this by creating as small floating window, containing the view as seen
from the front facing camera, allowing you to better pay attention to where you are going.

- **My intention is to make it so that I, or anybody else, never accidentally walks into a signpost/lightpost while walking and using their device...**

- _*`Which is honestly how I was struck by the idea; or rather: I struck the idea...  ?;\ lol.`*_
