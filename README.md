## WalkCam:

* WalkCam is an android app that helps improve your awareness while you are walking,
and using your mobile smartphone at the same time.
<sub> For me usually means termux, or another attention demanding application. </sub>
* It does this by creating as small floating window, containing the view as seen
from the front facing camera, allowing you to better pay attention to where you are going.
*My intention is to make it so that I, or anybody else, never walks into a lamp post accidentally again.*
_*Which is honestly how I was struck by the idea; or rather: I struck the idea...  ?;\ lol.*_
